# Templates

Edictum ships three built-in contract templates for common agent patterns, and you can create your own. Templates are complete, production-ready YAML bundles that you can load directly or use as a starting point.

## Use Cases

**Team/org-specific contract libraries.** A platform team creates a `shared-contracts/` directory with templates like `support-agent`, `billing-agent`, `onboarding-agent`. Individual developers load them by name without knowing the YAML details — `from_template("support-agent", template_dirs=["shared-contracts/"])`.

**Override built-in defaults per project.** A team that needs a stricter `file-agent` (e.g., blocking additional patterns like `terraform.tfvars`) can drop their custom `file-agent.yaml` into a project directory. The override is automatic — same `from_template("file-agent")` call, different behavior.

**Template discovery for tooling and CI.** `list_templates()` lets CLI tools, dashboards, or CI scripts enumerate all available templates across directories. A CI job can validate all templates in a repo without hardcoding names.

**Multi-repo contract sharing.** A monorepo or shared package can publish templates as YAML files. Consumer repos point `template_dirs` at the shared package's template directory.

## Which Template?

**Quick decision tree:**

- Need to protect files and bash commands? → `file-agent`
- Need output scanning and session limits? → `research-agent`
- Need role gates, ticket requirements, and all of the above? → `devops-agent`

**Comparison:**

| Capability | `file-agent` | `research-agent` | `devops-agent` |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Secret file protection | Yes | Yes (3 patterns) | Yes |
| Destructive bash denial | Yes | -- | Yes |
| Write scope enforcement | Yes | -- | -- |
| PII detection in output | -- | Yes | Yes |
| Session limits | -- | 50 calls / 100 attempts | 20 calls / 50 attempts |
| Role-gated deploys | -- | -- | Yes |
| Ticket requirements | -- | -- | Yes |

All templates can be customized after loading. See [Customizing Built-in Templates](#customizing-built-in-templates) below.

---

## Loading a Template

Use `Edictum.from_template()` to load a built-in template by name:

```python
from edictum import Edictum

guard = Edictum.from_template("file-agent")
```

This is equivalent to calling `Edictum.from_yaml()` on the template's YAML file, which means it goes through the same validation, compilation, and contract bundle hashing path as any custom bundle.

All `from_yaml()` options are available on `from_template()`:

```python
from edictum import Edictum
from edictum.audit import FileAuditSink, RedactionPolicy

guard = Edictum.from_template(
    "devops-agent",
    environment="staging",
    mode="observe",                                # shadow-test before enforcing
    audit_sink=FileAuditSink("audit.jsonl"),
    redaction=RedactionPolicy(sensitive_keys={"database_url"}),
)
```

Available built-in template names:

| Template | Target Use Case |
|---|---|
| `file-agent` | Agents that read/write files and run shell commands |
| `research-agent` | Agents that call APIs, search the web, and produce reports |
| `devops-agent` | Agents that manage infrastructure, deploy services, and handle CI/CD |

---

## `file-agent`

The file-agent template protects against the two most common file-handling risks: reading secrets and running destructive shell commands. It also enforces a write scope that prevents agents from writing to arbitrary absolute paths.

### Contracts

| Contract ID | Type | Tool | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `block-sensitive-reads` | pre | `read_file` | Blocks reads of files containing `.env`, `.secret`, `kubeconfig`, `credentials`, `.pem`, or `id_rsa` in the path. |
| `block-destructive-bash` | pre | `bash` | Blocks `rm -rf` / `rm --recursive`, `mkfs` (filesystem format), and writes to `/dev/`. |
| `block-write-outside-target` | pre | `write_file` | Blocks writes to absolute paths (starting with `/`). Forces agents to use relative paths within a controlled working directory. |

    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Write to absolute path '{args.path}' denied. Use relative paths."
      tags: [write-scope]
```

### Contract Details

**block-sensitive-reads** -- This precondition targets the `read_file` tool and checks whether `args.path` contains any of six sensitive file patterns. The `contains_any` operator is a substring match, so `args.path: "/home/user/.env.local"` would match on `.env`. This catches common secret files: environment configs (`.env`), credential stores, Kubernetes configs, SSH keys, and TLS certificates.

**block-destructive-bash** -- This precondition targets the `bash` tool and uses an `any` combinator to match three categories of destructive commands. The `matches` operator uses regex word boundaries (`\b`) to avoid false positives -- `rm -rf` is denied but `perform` is not. The `contains` check for `> /dev/` catches attempts to write to device files.

**block-write-outside-target** -- This precondition targets `write_file` and uses `starts_with: /` to block any absolute path. The intent is to force agents to operate within a relative working directory, preventing writes to system paths like `/etc/` or `/usr/`. If your agent needs to write to specific absolute paths, replace this contract with a more targeted allowlist.

---

## `research-agent`

The research-agent template is designed for agents that gather information from APIs, databases, and the web. It provides secret file protection, PII detection in output, and session-level rate limiting to prevent runaway agents.

### Contracts

| Contract ID | Type | Tool | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `block-sensitive-reads` | pre | `read_file` | Blocks reads of `.env`, `.secret`, and `credentials` files. |
| `pii-in-output` | post | `*` (all tools) | Warns when tool output contains US Social Security Number patterns. |
| `session-limits` | session | -- | Caps the session at 50 tool executions and 100 total attempts. |

    when:
      args.path:
        contains_any: [".env", ".secret", "credentials"]

    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Session limit reached. Summarize progress and stop."
      tags: [rate-limit]
```

### Contract Details

**block-sensitive-reads** -- A targeted version of the file-agent's secret protection. It checks for three common patterns (`.env`, `.secret`, `credentials`) rather than the full six-pattern set. Research agents typically don't interact with SSH keys or TLS certificates, so the pattern list is narrower.

**pii-in-output** -- This postcondition runs against all tools (wildcard `*`) and uses `matches_any` with a regex pattern for US Social Security Numbers (`\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}`). Because this is a postcondition, it cannot block the tool call -- it emits a warning so the agent (or a human reviewer) knows to redact the output before using it downstream. To detect additional PII patterns like IBAN numbers or credit card numbers, add more regex patterns to the `matches_any` array.

**session-limits** -- The session contract sets two counters. `max_tool_calls: 50` caps successful executions, preventing an agent from doing unbounded work. `max_attempts: 100` caps total contract evaluations, including denied calls. The attempt limit is set higher than the tool call limit because some denied calls are expected (the agent may probe a few denied paths before finding an allowed one). If attempts hit the ceiling, the agent is likely stuck in a denial loop.

---

## `devops-agent`

The devops-agent template is the most comprehensive built-in contract bundle. It combines secret protection, destructive command denial, role-based access control for production deploys, ticket-required change management, PII detection, and session limits.

### Contracts

| Contract ID | Type | Tool | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `block-sensitive-reads` | pre | `read_file` | Blocks reads of six sensitive file patterns. |
| `block-destructive-bash` | pre | `bash` | Blocks `rm -rf`, `mkfs`, and writes to `/dev/`. |
| `prod-deploy-requires-senior` | pre | `deploy_service` | Production deploys require `senior_engineer`, `sre`, or `admin` role. |
| `prod-requires-ticket` | pre | `deploy_service` | Production deploys require a `ticket_ref` on the principal. |
| `pii-in-output` | post | `*` (all tools) | Warns on SSN patterns in output. |
| `session-limits` | session | -- | Caps at 20 tool calls, 50 attempts. |

```

### Contract Details

**block-sensitive-reads** -- Identical to the file-agent version. Catches the full six-pattern set of sensitive files.

**block-destructive-bash** -- Identical to the file-agent version. Uses regex word boundaries to precisely match destructive commands without false positives.

**prod-deploy-requires-senior** -- This precondition uses an `all` combinator with two conditions: the environment must be `production` AND the principal's role must not be in the `[senior_engineer, sre, admin]` list. Both conditions must be true for the deny to fire. This means the contract only denies production deploys by non-senior roles -- staging and development deploys by any role are unaffected. If no principal is attached to the call, `principal.role` evaluates as missing, which means the `not_in` check evaluates to `false`, and the `all` block short-circuits to `false` -- the contract does not fire. To catch missing principals, pair this with a separate `principal.role: { exists: false }` check.

**prod-requires-ticket** -- This precondition also uses `all` to combine two conditions: production environment and missing ticket reference. The `exists: false` operator checks whether `principal.ticket_ref` is absent or null. This enforces change management: every production deploy must be traceable to a ticket. Non-production environments are unaffected.

**pii-in-output** -- Same as the research-agent version. Detects US SSN patterns in tool output and emits a warning.

**session-limits** -- Tighter limits than the research-agent template (20 tool calls, 50 attempts). DevOps agents typically perform fewer but higher-impact operations, so lower caps are appropriate. The limit message instructs the agent to summarize progress and stop, which gives operators a chance to review what happened before allowing more work.

## Custom Template Directories

You can create your own templates and load them with the `template_dirs` parameter. User directories are searched first; built-in templates serve as a fallback.

```python
from edictum import Edictum

# Load a custom template from your project
guard = Edictum.from_template(
    "support-agent",
    template_dirs=["./contracts/templates"],
)
```

Multiple directories are searched in order — the first match wins:

```python
guard = Edictum.from_template(
    "my-agent",
    template_dirs=["./team-contracts", "./shared-contracts"],
)
```

A user template with the same name as a built-in overrides it:

```python
# If ./contracts/templates/file-agent.yaml exists,
# it takes precedence over the built-in file-agent template
guard = Edictum.from_template(
    "file-agent",
    template_dirs=["./contracts/templates"],
)
```

Backward compatible — calling `from_template()` without `template_dirs` works exactly as before:

```python
guard = Edictum.from_template("file-agent")  # still loads the built-in
```

---

## Creating a Template

A template is a standard YAML contract bundle file (`.yaml`). Place it in a directory and pass that directory to `template_dirs`.

### Template structure

Every template follows the same YAML schema as any contract bundle:

```yaml
apiVersion: edictum/v1
kind: ContractBundle

metadata:
  name: support-agent
  description: "Contracts for customer support agents."

defaults:
  mode: enforce

contracts:
  - id: block-ticket-leak
    type: pre
    tool: send_message
    when:
      args.body: { contains: "TICKET-" }
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Internal ticket references must not appear in customer messages."
      tags: [compliance, data-leak]

  - id: session-limits
    type: session
    limits:
      max_tool_calls: 30
      max_attempts: 60
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Session limit reached."
      tags: [rate-limit]
```

### Project layout

A typical project keeps templates alongside application code:

```
my-agent/
├── contracts/
│   └── templates/
│       ├── support-agent.yaml
│       └── billing-agent.yaml
├── app.py
└── pyproject.toml
```

```python
# app.py
from edictum import Edictum

guard = Edictum.from_template(
    "support-agent",
    template_dirs=["./contracts/templates"],
)
```

### Tips for writing templates

- **Use descriptive contract IDs.** IDs like `block-ticket-leak` are searchable in audit logs. Avoid generic names like `rule-1`.
- **Tag contracts.** Tags (`tags: [compliance, pii]`) make it easy to filter audit events by category.
- **Set session limits.** Every production template should include a session contract to prevent runaway agents.
- **Start in observe mode.** Use `mode: observe` in `defaults:` while developing, then switch to `enforce` after validating with `edictum test`.
- **Validate before deploying.** Run `edictum validate contracts/templates/support-agent.yaml` to catch schema errors early.

---

## Discovering Templates

Use `Edictum.list_templates()` to discover all available templates — both built-in and from custom directories:

```python
from edictum import Edictum

# Built-in templates only
for t in Edictum.list_templates():
    print(f"{t.name} (built-in: {t.builtin})")
```

Output:

```
devops-agent (built-in: True)
file-agent (built-in: True)
research-agent (built-in: True)
```

With custom directories:

```python
templates = Edictum.list_templates(
    template_dirs=["./contracts/templates"],
)
for t in templates:
    source = "built-in" if t.builtin else str(t.path)
    print(f"{t.name}: {source}")
```

Output:

```
support-agent: contracts/templates/support-agent.yaml
devops-agent: built-in
file-agent: built-in
research-agent: built-in
```

Each entry is a `TemplateInfo` with three fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `str` | Template name (filename without `.yaml`) |
| `path` | `Path` | Absolute path to the YAML file |
| `builtin` | `bool` | `True` for built-in templates, `False` for user templates |

When a user template has the same name as a built-in, `list_templates()` returns only the user version — matching the search order of `from_template()`.

---

## Customizing Built-in Templates

Built-in templates are a starting point. Two approaches:

**Option 1: Override with `template_dirs`.** Copy a built-in template to your project directory, modify it, and load it by name. Your version takes priority automatically.

**Option 2: Load directly with `from_yaml()`.** Copy the template, rename it, and load the modified version:

```python
from edictum import Edictum

guard = Edictum.from_yaml("contracts/my-devops-policy.yaml")
```

Common customizations:

- **Add PII patterns.** Extend `pii-in-output` with IBAN, credit card, or country-specific ID number regex patterns in the `matches_any` array.
- **Adjust session limits.** Increase or decrease `max_tool_calls` and `max_attempts` based on your agent's expected workload.
- **Add per-tool limits.** Add `max_calls_per_tool` to the session contract to cap specific high-impact tools like `deploy_service` or `send_notification`.
- **Add observe-mode contracts.** Add new preconditions with `mode: observe` to shadow-test contracts before enforcing them. Observed denials are logged as `CALL_WOULD_DENY` audit events without denying the tool call.
- **Target additional tools.** Add preconditions for tools specific to your stack (e.g., `run_migration`, `delete_pod`, `send_email`).
- **Expand sensitive file patterns.** Add entries to `contains_any` arrays to cover patterns specific to your infrastructure (e.g., `terraform.tfvars`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`).
