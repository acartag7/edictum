# Use Cases

Real scenarios where Edictum prevents AI agents from causing harm. Each example includes a complete contract bundle you can copy and customize.

---

## Coding Agent

**The problem.** A coding agent has access to `read_file`, `write_file`, and `bash`. Without enforcement, it can read `.env` files, leak API keys in its responses, and run `rm -rf /` if a jailbreak succeeds. The BashClassifier and secret redaction handle most of this automatically.

**Quick start with a template:**

```python
from edictum import Edictum

guard = Edictum.from_template("file-agent")
```

**Complete contract bundle:**

```yaml
apiVersion: edictum/v1
kind: ContractBundle

metadata:
  name: coding-agent

defaults:
  mode: enforce

contracts:
  - id: block-sensitive-reads
    type: pre
    tool: read_file
    when:
      args.path:
        contains_any: [".env", ".secret", "kubeconfig", "credentials", ".pem", "id_rsa"]
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Sensitive file '{args.path}' denied."
      tags: [secrets, dlp]

  - id: block-destructive-bash
    type: pre
    tool: bash
    when:
      any:
        - args.command: { matches: '\\brm\\s+(-rf?|--recursive)\\b' }
        - args.command: { matches: '\\bmkfs\\b' }
        - args.command: { contains: '> /dev/' }
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Destructive command denied: '{args.command}'."
      tags: [destructive, safety]

  - id: block-write-outside-target
    type: pre
    tool: write_file
    when:
      args.path:
        starts_with: /
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Write to absolute path '{args.path}' denied. Use relative paths."
      tags: [write-scope]
```

**Wiring code:**

```python
import asyncio
from edictum import Edictum, EdictumDenied

async def main():
    guard = Edictum.from_template("file-agent")

    # Every tool call goes through guard.run()
    try:
        result = await guard.run(
            "read_file",
            {"path": "/app/.env"},
            read_file_fn,
        )
    except EdictumDenied as e:
        print(f"Denied: {e.reason}")
        # => "Denied: Sensitive file '/app/.env' denied."

asyncio.run(main())
```

**What this showcases: automatic security.** Secret values are auto-redacted in audit events and denial messages. Bash commands are sanitized (passwords, tokens, connection strings). Contract errors fail closed -- a misconfigured contract denies by default, never silently passes.

---

## Healthcare / Pharma

**The problem.** A clinical assistant has access to `query_clinical_data` and `update_patient_record`. A nurse should be able to read vitals for their assigned patients but never access psychiatric notes. An unauthenticated request should never reach patient data at all.

**Complete contract bundle:**

```yaml
apiVersion: edictum/v1
kind: ContractBundle

metadata:
  name: healthcare-agent

defaults:
  mode: enforce

contracts:
  - id: require-authenticated-principal
    type: pre
    tool: query_clinical_data
    when:
      principal.role:
        exists: false
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Clinical data access requires an authenticated principal."
      tags: [access-control, hipaa]

  - id: restrict-psychiatric-notes
    type: pre
    tool: query_clinical_data
    when:
      all:
        - args.data_type: { equals: psychiatric_notes }
        - principal.role: { not_in: [psychiatrist, attending_physician] }
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Access to psychiatric notes denied for role '{principal.role}'. Requires psychiatrist or attending physician."
      tags: [access-control, hipaa, psychiatric]

  - id: restrict-patient-updates
    type: pre
    tool: update_patient_record
    when:
      principal.role: { not_in: [physician, attending_physician, nurse_practitioner] }
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Patient record updates denied for role '{principal.role}'."
      tags: [access-control, hipaa]

  - id: session-cap
    type: session
    limits:
      max_tool_calls: 30
      max_attempts: 60
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Session limit reached. End consultation and start a new session."
      tags: [rate-limit]
```

**Wiring code:**

```python
from edictum import Edictum, Principal
from edictum.adapters.langchain import LangChainAdapter

guard = Edictum.from_yaml("healthcare.yaml")

# Principal comes from your auth layer -- JWT claims, session context, etc.
adapter = LangChainAdapter(
    guard,
    principal=Principal(
        role="nurse",
        claims={"department": "cardiology", "assigned_patients": ["P-1234"]},
    ),
)
wrapper = adapter.as_tool_wrapper()
```

**What this showcases: access control.** Principal claims and role gates enforce who can access what. Dynamic messages include the denied role so audit logs are immediately actionable. Session caps prevent runaway queries.

---

## Finance

**The problem.** A financial analysis agent queries databases and returns results to analysts. Query results often contain SSNs, account numbers, and other PII. The agent shouldn't be denied access to the data -- it needs it to do analysis -- but PII should never appear in the response the analyst sees.

**Complete contract bundle:**

```yaml
apiVersion: edictum/v1
kind: ContractBundle

metadata:
  name: finance-agent

defaults:
  mode: enforce

tools:
  query_database:
    side_effect: read

contracts:
  - id: redact-ssn-in-output
    type: post
    tool: query_database
    when:
      output.text:
        matches: '\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b'
    then:
      effect: redact
      message: "SSN pattern detected and redacted from query result."
      tags: [pii, compliance]

  - id: redact-account-numbers
    type: post
    tool: query_database
    when:
      output.text:
        matches: '\b\d{8,17}\b'
    then:
      effect: redact
      message: "Account number pattern detected and redacted."
      tags: [pii, compliance]

  - id: block-bulk-export
    type: pre
    tool: query_database
    when:
      args.query:
        matches: '(?i)select\s+\*.*limit\s+\d{4,}'
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Bulk data export denied. Use targeted queries with reasonable limits."
      tags: [dlp, compliance]

  - id: transaction-session-cap
    type: session
    limits:
      max_tool_calls: 15
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Query limit reached for this analysis session."
      tags: [rate-limit]
```

**Wiring code:**

```python
from edictum import Edictum, EdictumDenied

guard = Edictum.from_yaml("finance.yaml")

# The tool executes, postconditions scan the output, PII is redacted
result = await guard.run(
    "query_database",
    {"query": "SELECT name, ssn, balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 42"},
    db_query_fn,
)
# result contains "***-**-****" instead of the actual SSN
```

**What this showcases: postcondition effects.** `effect: redact` strips PII from tool output before the agent sees it. The tool still executes -- the agent gets the data it needs for analysis, but sensitive patterns are replaced. `effect: deny` on postconditions suppresses the entire output.

---

## DevOps

**The problem.** A DevOps agent manages deployments, runs diagnostics, and modifies infrastructure. You need production deploy gates (only seniors, only with tickets), bash safety, and a way to roll out new contracts without breaking existing enforcement.

**Quick start with a template:**

```python
from edictum import Edictum

guard = Edictum.from_template("devops-agent")
```

**Complete contract bundle:**

```yaml
apiVersion: edictum/v1
kind: ContractBundle

metadata:
  name: devops-agent

defaults:
  mode: enforce

contracts:
  - id: prod-deploy-requires-senior
    type: pre
    tool: deploy_service
    when:
      all:
        - env.DEPLOY_ENV: { equals: production }
        - principal.role: { not_in: [senior_engineer, sre, admin] }
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Production deploys require senior role (sre/admin)."
      tags: [change-control, production]

  - id: prod-requires-ticket
    type: pre
    tool: deploy_service
    when:
      all:
        - env.DEPLOY_ENV: { equals: production }
        - principal.ticket_ref: { exists: false }
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Production changes require a ticket reference."
      tags: [change-control, compliance]

  - id: block-destructive-bash
    type: pre
    tool: bash
    when:
      any:
        - args.command: { matches: '\\brm\\s+(-rf?|--recursive)\\b' }
        - args.command: { matches: '\\bmkfs\\b' }
        - args.command: { contains: '> /dev/' }
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Destructive command denied."
      tags: [destructive, safety]

  - id: session-limits
    type: session
    limits:
      max_tool_calls: 20
      max_attempts: 50
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Session limit reached. Summarize progress and stop."
      tags: [rate-limit]
```

**Safe rollout with observe_alongside:**

```yaml
# new-deploy-contracts.yaml -- shadow-tested alongside production contracts
apiVersion: edictum/v1
kind: ContractBundle

metadata:
  name: devops-v2-shadow

defaults:
  mode: observe_alongside

contracts:
  - id: require-rollback-plan
    type: pre
    tool: deploy_service
    when:
      principal.claims.rollback_plan:
        exists: false
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Deploy requires a rollback plan in principal claims."
      tags: [change-control]
```

```python
from edictum import Edictum

# Compose production + shadow contracts
guard = Edictum.from_yaml("devops.yaml", "new-deploy-contracts.yaml")

# Shadow contracts log what would be denied but don't block anything
# Review audit logs, then promote: change mode from observe_alongside to enforce
```

**Checking drift before promoting:**

```bash
# See what changed between bundle versions
$ edictum diff devops-v1.yaml devops-v2.yaml

# Replay historical audit events against new contracts
$ edictum replay --audit audit.jsonl --contracts devops-v2.yaml
```

**What this showcases: safe rollouts.** `observe_alongside` lets you shadow-test new contracts without affecting production enforcement. `edictum diff` shows exactly what changed. `edictum replay` predicts how new contracts would have affected past tool calls. Promote when you're confident.

---

## Education

**The problem.** A tutoring agent helps students with assignments. It has access to `search_web`, `run_code`, and `retrieve_document`. You need to prevent access to student records, cap tool calls per assignment session, and validate that your contracts behave correctly before deploying to students.

**Complete contract bundle:**

```yaml
apiVersion: edictum/v1
kind: ContractBundle

metadata:
  name: education-agent

defaults:
  mode: enforce

contracts:
  - id: block-student-records
    type: pre
    tool: retrieve_document
    when:
      args.path:
        contains_any: ["/grades/", "/transcripts/", "/disciplinary/"]
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Access to student records denied."
      tags: [ferpa, student-privacy]

  - id: block-answer-keys
    type: pre
    tool: retrieve_document
    when:
      args.path:
        contains: "/answer-keys/"
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Access to answer keys denied during student sessions."
      tags: [academic-integrity]

  - id: assignment-session-cap
    type: session
    limits:
      max_tool_calls: 25
      max_attempts: 50
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Session limit reached for this assignment. Submit your work and start a new session."
      tags: [rate-limit, academic-integrity]
```

**Testing contracts before deployment:**

```python
from edictum import Edictum

guard = Edictum.from_yaml("education.yaml")

# Dry-run: does this call get denied?
result = guard.evaluate(
    "retrieve_document",
    {"path": "/grades/student-123.json"},
)
assert result.verdict == "deny"
assert "student records" in result.deny_reasons[0].lower()

# Batch: test multiple scenarios at once
results = guard.evaluate_batch([
    {"tool": "retrieve_document", "args": {"path": "/textbooks/chapter-1.pdf"}},
    {"tool": "retrieve_document", "args": {"path": "/grades/student-456.json"}},
    {"tool": "run_code", "args": {"code": "print('hello')"}},
])
assert results[0].verdict == "allow"
assert results[1].verdict == "deny"
assert results[2].verdict == "allow"
```

**YAML test cases with edictum test:**

```yaml
# education-tests.yaml
apiVersion: edictum/v1
kind: ContractBundle
metadata:
  name: education-tests

tests:
  - description: "Student record access is denied"
    tool: retrieve_document
    args:
      path: "/grades/student-123.json"
    expect: deny

  - description: "Textbook access is allowed"
    tool: retrieve_document
    args:
      path: "/textbooks/chapter-1.pdf"
    expect: allow

  - description: "Answer key access is denied"
    tool: retrieve_document
    args:
      path: "/answer-keys/quiz-3.json"
    expect: deny
```

```bash
$ edictum test education.yaml --cases education-tests.yaml
  3 test cases: 3 passed, 0 failed
```

**What this showcases: contract testing.** `guard.evaluate()` dry-runs contracts without executing the tool. `evaluate_batch()` tests multiple scenarios at once. `edictum test` runs YAML test cases from the CLI with expected verdicts. CI/CD exit codes gate your deployment pipeline.

## Legal

**The problem.** A legal research agent has access to `search_documents`, `retrieve_case`, and `summarize_document`. It handles privileged attorney-client communications, confidential case files, and documents under regulatory hold. Every access must be auditable for compliance.

**Complete contract bundle:**

```yaml
apiVersion: edictum/v1
kind: ContractBundle

metadata:
  name: legal-agent

defaults:
  mode: enforce

contracts:
  - id: restrict-privileged-docs
    type: pre
    tool: retrieve_case
    when:
      all:
        - args.classification: { equals: privileged }
        - principal.role: { not_in: [attorney, partner, legal_ops] }
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Privileged document access denied for role '{principal.role}'."
      tags: [privilege, compliance]

  - id: block-regulatory-hold
    type: pre
    tool: retrieve_case
    when:
      args.tags:
        contains: regulatory_hold
    then:
      effect: deny
      message: "Document under regulatory hold. Access requires manual approval."
      tags: [regulatory, compliance]

  - id: redact-client-pii
    type: post
    tool: search_documents
    when:
      output.text:
        matches: '\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b'
    then:
      effect: redact
      message: "Client PII detected and redacted from search results."
      tags: [pii, compliance]
```

**Wiring with audit trail:**

```python
from edictum import Edictum, Principal
from edictum.audit import FileAuditSink, RedactionPolicy

# File sink writes structured JSONL -- one event per line, queryable
redaction = RedactionPolicy()
audit_sink = FileAuditSink("legal-audit.jsonl", redaction)

guard = Edictum.from_yaml(
    "legal.yaml",
    audit_sink=audit_sink,
    redaction=redaction,
)

# Every evaluation produces a structured audit event:
# - tool name, args (with secrets redacted), principal, verdict
# - policy_version hash ties every event to the exact contract bundle
# - timestamps, session counters, environment context

result = await guard.run(
    "retrieve_case",
    {"case_id": "2024-CF-1234", "classification": "privileged"},
    retrieve_case_fn,
    principal=Principal(role="attorney", claims={"bar_number": "12345"}),
)
```

**Audit event example** (written to `legal-audit.jsonl`):

```json
{
  "action": "call_allowed",
  "tool_name": "retrieve_case",
  "tool_args": {"case_id": "2024-CF-1234", "classification": "privileged"},
  "principal": {"role": "attorney", "claims": {"bar_number": "12345"}},
  "policy_version": "a3f8c2...",
  "environment": "production",
  "session_attempt_count": 1,
  "session_execution_count": 1
}
```

**What this showcases: observability.** Every evaluation -- allowed, denied, or observed -- produces a structured audit event. The `policy_version` hash ties each event to the exact contract bundle that was loaded. `FileAuditSink` writes JSONL for compliance archives. OpenTelemetry spans emit the same data for Grafana, Datadog, or any OTel-compatible backend.

## Common Workflows

### Composing templates with custom contracts

Start with a built-in template and layer your own contracts on top:

```python
from edictum import Edictum

# Template provides base contracts, your YAML adds domain-specific ones
guard = Edictum.from_yaml(
    "file-agent",        # built-in template (secret protection, bash safety)
    "my-overrides.yaml", # your custom contracts
)
```

Or merge multiple guards programmatically:

```python
base = Edictum.from_template("file-agent")
custom = Edictum.from_yaml("custom.yaml")
guard = Edictum.from_multiple([base, custom])
```

### Dry-run testing

Test your contracts before deploying:

```python
guard = Edictum.from_yaml("contracts.yaml")

# Single call
result = guard.evaluate("read_file", {"path": ".env"})
print(result.verdict)       # "deny"
print(result.deny_reasons)  # ["Sensitive file '.env' denied."]

# Batch -- test an entire scenario
results = guard.evaluate_batch([
    {"tool": "read_file", "args": {"path": "README.md"}},
    {"tool": "read_file", "args": {"path": ".env"}},
    {"tool": "bash", "args": {"command": "ls -la"}},
    {"tool": "bash", "args": {"command": "rm -rf /"}},
])
# => [allow, deny, allow, deny]
```

From the CLI:

```bash
# Quick check
$ edictum check contracts.yaml --tool read_file --args '{"path": ".env"}'
  DENIED by block-sensitive-reads

# Run test suite
$ edictum test contracts.yaml --cases tests.yaml
  4 test cases: 4 passed, 0 failed
```

### Observe, then enforce

Start in observe mode to see what your contracts would deny without actually denying anything. Review the audit log. Tune. Then enforce.

```yaml
# Step 1: Deploy in observe mode
defaults:
  mode: observe

# Step 2: Review audit logs -- look for CALL_WOULD_DENY events
# Step 3: Tune contracts based on false positives
# Step 4: Switch to enforce
defaults:
  mode: enforce
```

For incremental rollout of new contracts alongside existing enforcement:

```yaml
# new-contracts.yaml
defaults:
  mode: observe_alongside

contracts:
  - id: new-restriction
    # ... this contract logs but doesn't deny
```

```python
guard = Edictum.from_yaml("production.yaml", "new-contracts.yaml")
# Production contracts enforce normally
# New contracts shadow-log only
```
